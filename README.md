# hello-world
This is my first repository!

I am really happy that I am finally going to learn how to use GitHub. I used it at my last job but now that I am pushing myself to learn a programming language and step my game all the way up, here I am . I have to learn Bash, get certified in AWS and it would be nice to have GitHub experience as well. 

I am tired of being border line good at Linux and using different tools while I see other making it happen, they had to study and learn at one point they didn't understand this stuff either, so I can totally get this going.
